CSF

CSF (ConfigServer Security & Firewall) is a free, advanced firewall tool designed for most Linux-based VPS/Cloud environments. In addition to basic packet filtering, CSF offers enhanced security features, including login intrusion and flood detection.

Login Security: If there are 10 unsuccessful login attempts, the IP address attempting the logins will be blocked by CSF. This blocking is determined based on the IP address and its subnet mask, preventing incoming traffic from that source.

Traffic Control: CSF allows you to specify which ports can be used for outgoing traffic. For example, you can permit only essential ports like 80, 443, and 587, enhancing your server's security.

Command Features: With CSF commands, you can manage IP addresses on the server firewall. This includes allowing, denying, blocking, and unblocking specific IPs, providing granular control over your server's security.

Overall, CSF provides robust security measures to protect your Linux-based VPS/Cloud environment from various threats.
